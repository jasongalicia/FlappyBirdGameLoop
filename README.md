# Flappy Bird In Java Using A Game Loop

The recreation of Flappy Bird is here! Recreated in Java USING A ACTUAL GAME LOOP, you are able to play this game.
The goal of this game is to get through as many pipes and you must jump through them because the character is in free fall. Once you make contact
with either the ground or the pipes, you lose the game.

Please feel free to visit the [Timer Loop Version of this game.](https://github.com/jasongalicia/Flappy-Bird-Game-Java-Timer-Loop)
